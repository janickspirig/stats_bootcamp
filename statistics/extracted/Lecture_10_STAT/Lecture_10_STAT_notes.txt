Methods: Statistics (Spring 2021) I. Introduction ExampleCola Zero vs. Original:In last week’s blind test, students always had to tasteCola Zerofirst and wereasked to try theOriginalafterwards. This procedure may have biased the results.Therefore, 40 new students are recruited and randomly devided into two groups.One group tastes and evaluatesCola Zero, while the other group tastes and ratestheOriginal(on a 7-point scale from 1 = tastes bad to 7 = tastes great).The test results show that the «Cola Zero-Sample»has a mean value of 5.2, whilethe «Original-Sample» has a mean value of 5.9.Can you now conclude thatCola Zerodoesnottaste as good as the original?5

Methods: Statistics (Spring 2021) I. Basic IdeaThe introductory example aims to distinguish betweentwo unknown means(upto now, we only tested statements about single parameters). In order to investigatesuch an assumption, appropriate samples must be taken from the population.Samples are calledindependentif the selection of one sample does not affect theselection of the other sample. In contrast, one refers todependent samples(orpaired samples) if the selection process for one sample is related to the selectionprocess for the other sample. For instance, samples are dependent if theobservations of the first and second sample are taken from the same statistical unit(e.g., «before-after» comparisons).Depending on the sample at hand (independent vs. dependent) one has to usedifferent test proceduresto examine differences between samples.6

Methods: Statistics (Spring 2021) II. Comparing Means (Independent Samples)There are threedifferent methods for testing means of two independentsamples:•z-test•t-test for equal variances•t-test for unequal variancesThe choice of the appropriate method depends on whether the populationvariances areknown/unknownand whether they areequal/different. In addition,two-sample procedures are carried out in the same five steps as the hypothesistests covered so far:71.Hypotheses and significance level2.Test statistic and test distribution3.Critical value(s)4.Calculation of the test statistic5.Decision and interpretation

Estimate function for the population variance:The estimation function for the population variance in the case of homogeneity ofvariances is called«pooled variance». Thet-test for equal variances is thereforealso referred to as pooled-variancest-test.The above estimation function is determined by the corresponding variances andsizes of the two samples as well as the number of degrees of freedom:

After the exam, the lecturer computes the average numberof points as well as the corresponding standard deviations:Group 1:        = 77.1, s1= 7.8, n1= 25Group 2:        = 80.0, s2= 8.1, n2= 25Can a significant difference between the groups be detected under the assumptionof a normally distributed population and variance homogeneity (α= 0.05)?1.

Calculation of the degrees of freedom:For thet-test for unequal variances thedegrees of freedomof thet-distributionare calculated via the following formula:This formula is known as«Welch correction», which is the reason why thet-test for unequal variances is also referred to as Welch’st-test. A non-integervalue ofdfis rounded up or down.

Methods: Statistics (Spring 2021) III. Comparing Mean (Dependent Samples, Pairedt-Test)Twodependent samplesare available for this test.However,the differentpairsof measured values are independent of each other(e.g., pair 1 and pair 2 donot influence each other). The differences of the associated test values arenormally distributed in the population.Test statistic: with = difference between measurements of each individual unit:= average difference between measurements:= standard deviation of d:= sample size (number of pairs)= number of degrees of freedom: 19

Keyboards:A professor orders 12 ergonomic keyboards, which are given to a sample ofdoctoral students. If the new keyboards significantly improve productivity, theprofessor wants to replace all old keyboards.For this reason, all 12 doctoral students have to type a standardized document -once with the old keyboard and once with the ergonomic keyboard. The number ofwords per minute is measured.It turns out that the writing speed between the first and second measurementdiffers by -78.7 words per minute. Should the professor order the ergonomickeyboard for all doctoral students (α= 0.05)?

Confidence Interval for the Difference of MeansInstead of or in addition to the pairedt-test, a confidence interval can be calculated for the difference between two means. This results from the following formula:Confidence interval: with = difference between measurements of each individual unit:= average difference between measurements:= standard deviation of d:= sample size (number of pairs)= upper critical value of thet-distribution with n - 1 degrees of freedom23

Methods: Statistics (Spring 2021) VII. Variance TestIn some situations, the question arises whether two independent samples have thesame variances (H0:σ12=σ22). The prerequisites for this test are two independentsamples from normally distributed populations with the variancesσ12andσ22.Test statistic:, where the larger quotient is selected. The critical values are determined by the quantile F(α/2, n1, n2):•α= the specified significance level•n1= (n1- 1), the number of degrees of freedom in the counter•n2= (n2- 1), the number of degrees of freedom in the denominatorAs the test statisticFfollows an F-distribution, the variance test is called an F-test.27

Tutorial groups:For the previous example of two tutorial groups, it should be tested whether the assumption of variance homogeneity was justified (α= 0.05).1. Hypotheses and significance levels:H0: σ12=σ22;H1: σ12≠σ22; α= 0.052. Test statistic and test distribution:F-statistics with df= 24 in the numerator and df=24 in the denominator3. Critical value(s):For this two-tailed test there is only one critical value, as the greater of the of both quotients is chosen.= 0.05 → Fα/2= 2.27

Methods: Statistics (Spring 2021) 3. Calculation of the test statistic:3. Decision and interpretation:As the test statisticF = 1.08 is smaller than the critical value Fα/2= 2.27, the null hypothesis cannot be rejected at a significance level of 5%. Therefore, theassumption of equal variances in the previous example was justified.

Learning Objectives
After the lecture, you know how: 
• the association between random variables is measured and 
interpreted by using the concept of correlation.
• to distinguish between the concepts of correlation and causality and 
to apply them in practice-oriented examples.

I. Correlation vs. Causality
When pairwise observations are collected, the data can possibly be constituted
in a way such that a statistical correlation between the pairs can be calculated.
Correlation does not inevitable mean that a causal relationship exists. Thus, in
all statistical applications, especially in the examination of characteristics, great
attention has to be paid to the coherence in content in order to avoid misuse
(spurious correlation)!
Correlation means a connection between variables,
but without a cause-and-effect relation.
Causality means that two variables are connected
in a cause-and-effect relationship!

I. Correlation vs. Causality
Health-conscious people care for 
their teeth and take care of their 
cardiovascular system.
Finding: There is a connection
between shoe size (X) and income (Y).
Conjecture: People with large 
shoe size earn more.

Women have smaller shoe sizes 
than men. Women have lower 
incomes than men.
Finding: There is a connection between
pariodontosis (X) and heart disease (Y).

their teeth have heart problems.

II. Correlation Coefficient
The measurement of the strength of a statistical relationship between two 
metric-scale characteristics is part of correlation analysis.
The correlation coefficient (ρ) provides a measure of the strength and direction
of the correlation between two metrically measurable variables, e.g., body height
and income, or between the price of oil and the performance of a stock index.
ρ = −𝟏𝟏 perfectly negative linear association between the variables
(perfect negative correlation)
ρ = 𝟎𝟎 no linear association between the two variables 
(uncorrelatedness)
ρ = +𝟏𝟏 perfectly positive linear association between the variables
(perfect positive correlation)
−𝟏𝟏 < ρ < +𝟏𝟏 the association can more or less be approximated by an upward 
resp. downward sloping line.

III. Covariance
The correlation coefficient is a standardized measure (in the interval 
between -1 and +1) and is therefore independent of the units in which the 
variables are measured. It is determined by the covariance.
The non-standardized measure of covariance is calculated based on 
the sum of all products of the mean deviations of both data points.
For sample data, the population mean and standard deviation may be
replaced by the corresponding sample means and standard deviations:

Methods: Statistics (Spring 2022)
In case of continuous random variables the probability function is replaced by 
the so-called density function. The density function f(x) of a continuous random 
variable X is a continuous function for which holds:
Thus, the density function has the following properties:
1. The density function cannot be negative.
2. The area between the density function and the x-axis always equals 1.

I. Density Function of Continuous Random Variables
Note: The density of a continuous random variable X does NOT state the 
probability that the random variable takes a certain value x! This can also be 
seen from the fact that the density can take larger values than 1. In particular, 
for a single value x it holds:
P(X = x) = 0f o r  a l lx 
although X = x is not an impossible event!
The area below the density function over a specific interval corresponds to the 
probability that the random variable takes a value within this interval. In this 
context, it is irrelevant if the boundaries a and b are included in the interval or not. 
Formally stated:
P(a <  X  <b )  =P(a  X < b) = P(a < X  b) = P(a  X  b) =

The normal distribution is one of the most important continuous distributions, 
since many random variables occurring in practice are - at least approximately -
normally distributed. A continuous random variable X with the density function:
is normally distributed with the parameters 𝜇 and 𝜎
2. Many distributions (e.g., 
binomial distribution) can be approximated by the normal distribution.
Sample means as well as proportions of repeated samples tend to be normally
distributed (central limit theorem).

Methods: Statistics (Spring 2022)
For the standardized normal distribution (short: Φ(z)) there are "tables" which can 
be used to obtain "probability-areas" of standard normally distributed random 
variables. Each normally distributed random variable X with the parameters 𝜇 and 
𝜎
2 can be transformed into a standard normally distributed random variable Z
(standardization): 
The distribution function F of the random variable X is expressed by the 
distribution function  of the standard normal distribution:

An important characteristic of the normal distribution is that it can be used to 
approximate other distributions. For instance, the binomial distribution
approaches the form of a normal distribution with growing n.  A good 
approximation results, when the conditions
n𝜋൒ 5 and n (1  𝜋) ൒ 5
are fulfilled. 
Expected value: 𝜇 = n𝜋
Variance: 𝜎2 = n𝜋 (1  𝜋)

discrete, the approximation is improved
by the so-called continuity correction:

amount of time, space, or distance between occurrences of these rare
events (e.g., x is the time between successive arrivals). The cumulative
distribution and density function are:

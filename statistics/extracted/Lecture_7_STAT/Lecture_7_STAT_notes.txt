Methods: Statistics (Spring 2022) 
I. Concept of Sampling Theory
Statistical Inference : Using information from a random sample to make
conclusions about the unknown distribution or unknown parameter values of the
population from which the sample is drawn.
The number n of chosen elements from the population is the sample size.E a c h
observed element x
i can be considered as a realization of a random variable, the
so-called i-th sample variable Xi (i = 1, ..., n).
Realizations of the sample are fed into a sample function (e.g., to determine the
population mean or the variance). The result of the sample function is also a
random variable. All possible realizations of a sample function (and their
corresponding probabilities) form a sampling distribution , described by its
distribution function, mean, and variance.

The sampling distribution of the mean has the same expected value as the
population. The standard deviation of the sampling distribution of the mean is
called standard error of the mean.

Consider a normally distributed random variable X  N(
, ). Each individual 
sample X1, …, Xn is also a random variable with Xi  N(
, ) and observed 
realization x1, …, xn , i = 1, …, n. The sample mean as a function of random 
variables is also a random variable:
Each linear combination of independent, normally distributed random variables is 
again normally distributed. The random variable "sample mean" is normally 
distributed with mean and variance:

III. Central Limit Theorem
Given a population of arbitrary distribution with mean
 and standard deviation
,
then the distribution of the arithmetic mean of n independent and identically (as
the population) distributed ( i.i.d.) random variables Xi approaches with growing
sample size n  a normal distribution with expected value
 and variance
2 / n
(i.e., the sample mean is asymptotically normally distributed).
The central limit theorem justifies that for any distribution of the population the
distribution of the mean can be approximated by the normal distribution if the
sample size is sufficiently large (n  30).

1. Distribution of the sampling mean has the same mean as the population: 
2. The standard deviation of the sample mean distribution is: 
(if     normally distr., e.g., because CLT applies)
3a.  If the population is normally distributed, the sampling distribution of the mean
is normally distributed as well.
3b. If the population is not normally distributed, the distribution of the mean of n
independent random variables Xi approaches a normal distribution with a
growing sample size (implied by CLT).
4.     Then, the standardized random variable is 
(asymptotically) normally distributed.

Production time: An accurately adjusted machine needs 25 seconds on average
for the production of a component, with a standard deviation of 3 seconds. A
random sample ( n = 36) resulted in a sample mean of 26.2 seconds for the
completion of one component. What is the probability – assuming the machine is
accurately adjusted – that the mean of this sample is bigger or equal to 26.2?

IV. Sampling Distribution (Example)
Waiting time: The branch manager of a bank finds out that the waiting time of
customers at the counter is exponentially distributed with a mean (and standard
deviation) of 3.5 minutes. Determine (under consideration of the CLT), for a
random sample of n = 36 customers, the probability that the average waiting time
was longer than 4 minutes.
Reason: 
 = 
 = 3.5; with n = 36, the mean value of the sample is approximately 
normal distributed due to the central limit theorem with
x = 3.5!

V. Sampling Distribution of the Proportion
The binomial distribution with probability function f(x) of X is defined by :
The proportion of success x in a sample of n trials will be the sample proportion
p = x / n, resp. x = pn. The expected value E(p) and the variance of the 
proportional value are calculated as follows:

If conditions nπ  5 and n(1-π)  5 are fulfilled, the sampling
distribution of the proportions is approximately normal distributed.
As the sample size increases, the standard error of the proportion 
becomes smaller.
The standardized proportion is given by:

Product preference: A product manager claims that 55% of the potential
customers in a certain target group prefer his product over that of the competitor.
Assume his claim is true; what is then the probability that in a random sample of
300 people of the target group at least 60% prefer the manager's product?

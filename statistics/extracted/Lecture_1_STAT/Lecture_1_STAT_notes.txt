II. Scales of Measurement
A statistical population consists of different units with identical factual,
temporal, and spatial characteristics. The survey (or partial census) determines
an observation value for them, i.e. one of the possible characteristic values is
assigned to each unit.
The scale of measurement influences both the collectability of data and the
choice of the appropriate sampling technique, and thus, the information content of
the measurement results. We distinguish between the following types of scales:

II. Scale of Measurement
Type of Scale Scale Properties / Examples
qualitative nominal
A = B or A  B
distinctiveness, number represents category,
e.g. gender, profession or nationality
comparative ordinal
A = B or A < B or A > B 
possibility to build a rank order
e.g. ratings, grades, preferences
quantitative
interval
A = B or A < B or A > B and
B - A = C - B or B - A < C - B or B - A - A > C - B,
ranking and equal intervals between scale values,
e.g. year of birth, deviation from norm, Celsius
ratio
same as interval scale and
A = x * B
rationale zero point, equal intervals between adjacent
scale values, calculation of measurement
e.g. prices, income, turnover, weight

II. Description of Data
1) Qualitative variables assign objects to a category:
Examples: gender, legal structure of company, nationality
2) Quantitative variables assign a value to an object:
• Discrete: Variables can take only certain values along an interval. 
Examples: Numbers in roulette from 0 - 36, numbers on dice.
• Continuous: Variables can take any value in an interval. 
Examples: Speed, any value between 0 and 250 km/h

In the example of the price ranges 
of apartments in the Canton of 
Zurich, the following questions, 
among others, can be answered:
• What is the proportion of a 
single price segment?
• To what extent do the price 
segments differ with respect to
their respective frequencies?

that a tabular or graphical representation provides a deeper insight into the
information content of the data.

III. Description of Data
In order to be able to compare several
frequencies better - at a glance - it is
advisable to display them graphically
in the form of the bar chart.
This diagram consists of bars erected
above the characteristic values and
whose areas are proportional
(directly) to the frequencies of the
respective characteristics.
Therefore, the weightings of the
different characteristic values can
directly be compared. In this regard it
is called a „frequency distribution“
resp. „histogram“.

Apartments in the Canton of Zurich

In the case of a symmetrical distribution, the mean value, median and mode
are the same: 
A symmetrical distribution has a skewness of 0. The skewness describes the 
tendency of the distribution to assume extreme values at the left or right at the
end of the distribution function with above-average probabilities.

Measures of dispersion characterize the spread of individual values around the 
center of the distribution. They play an essential role in many statistical tests. 
Important parameters include among others:
• variance
• standard deviation (square root of the variance)
• mean absolute deviation
• interquartile range
• range

Chebyshev theorem: The percentage of observations that lie within k standard
deviations symmetrically around the mean will be at least:
Intuition: The smaller the standard deviation of the distribution, the greater the
probability that individual observations are close to the mean value. The theorem
specifies the minimum percentage of observations that fall within a given number
of standard deviations from the mean.

The Chebyshev theorem is valid for any distribution. However, the following rules of 
thumb apply only to bell-shaped, symmetrical distributions:
• about 68% of the observations fall within one SD around the mean value
• about 95% of the observations fall within two SD around the mean value
• almost all (99.7%) observations fall within three SD around the mean value

The Kurtosis expresses whether the distribution is rather narrow-pointed or
broad-pointed compared to a normal distribution. With the same standard 
deviation, distributions can therefore concentrate differently around the mean.
Distribution 1: Mean=0, Variance=1.5, Skewness=0, Excess Kurtosis=3
Distribution 2: Mean=0, variance=1.5, Skewness=0, Excess Kurtosis=0
Distribution 3: Mean=0, Variance=1.5, Skewness=0, Excess Kurtosis=-0.5

Quartiles Q1, Q2, Q3 divide the (sorted) population into four equally sized
sub-populations (i.e., the first 25% of the values are smaller than Q1, Q2
corresponds to the median, 75% of the values are smaller than Q3).
The quartile distance (interquartile range) indicates the range of the 50%
mean values and is defined as follows: IQR = Q3 – Q1 . The interquartile
range is a measure of dispersion, but the individual quartiles represent
measures of central tendency.

• A rectangle (box) ranging from the 1st

• A connection line from the middle of 
the box to the vertical dashes of the

Given is a population with  and variance  2 from which the observations x1, …, 
xn are drawn randomly (with replacement). It follows that the sample variance is 
an unbiased estimator of the variance in the population (this implies E(s2) =  2).

I. Random Variables
Starting point is the outcome (elementary events) of a random experiment:
• qualitative, e.g., "head" or "number" when tossing a coin
• quantitative, e.g., dice with the results 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
The random variable X is a function that assigns each outcome of a random 
experiment a numerical value. Formally, X is a mapping W to real numbers. The 
value that X takes is called realization (expressed in lowercase x).
Consider a random experiment with set Ω that collects all possible outcomes of 
the random experiment (e.g., throw a coin):
• observed outcome w Î W (either “heads (H)” or “tails (T)”)
• random variable X assigns the outcome a real number:
e.g, 𝑥𝑥(𝐻𝐻) = 1 and 𝑥𝑥(𝑇𝑇) = 0

I. Random Variables
A random variable which maps outcomes to values of a:
1. countable* set is called discrete;
2. uncountable set is called continuous.
Intuition:
• A discrete random variable can take only "single" values (in particular, this 
involves the case that the sample space is finite).
• A continuous random variable can take any value in a continuum (real interval).
8
* A set is called countable if it has the same cardinality as some subset of the set of natural numbers.


--- Slide 9 of 41 ---

Methods: Statistics (Spring 2021)
A discrete random variable X can take a value xi with a probability:
0 £ P(X = xi) £ 1, 
The function f, which assigns a probability to each xi , f (xi) = P(X = xi), is called
probability function of the discrete random variable X (see Kolmogorov’s
Axioms). Only one value xi can occur for a given experiment.
A discrete probability function illustrates all possible outcomes of an
experiment, along with their corresponding probabilities.
We define a probability function as the relative frequency distribution that
should theoretically occur for observations from a given population.

Let X be the number of pips after rolling a fair dice. The probability function of
X reads (discrete uniform distribution):
𝑃𝑃(𝑋𝑋 = 𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖) = 1/6 𝑖𝑖 = 1, … , 6
Probability functions are generally illustrated by bar charts.

We are often interested in the probability that a random variable 𝑋𝑋 takes values 
that are not greater than a specified value 𝑥𝑥. This is done by the (cumulative) 
distribution function 𝐹𝐹(𝑥𝑥) which is described by:
𝐹𝐹(𝑥𝑥) = 𝑃𝑃(𝑋𝑋£𝑥𝑥) = �
𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖≤𝑥𝑥
𝑃𝑃(𝑋𝑋 = 𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖).

V. Chebyshev Inequality
Chebyshev’s inequality provides a minimum value for the probability that the 
random variable takes realizations within an interval symmetric around the mean 
(in terms of multiples of a standard deviation). Given a random variable X with 
expected value µ and standard deviation of σ it holds that:
Applies regardless of the distribution of 𝑋𝑋!
Specifies a very conservative lower limit!

V. Chebyshev Inequality (Example)
A random variable 𝑋𝑋 has the expected value 𝜇𝜇 = 6 and the variance 𝜎𝜎2 = 9. There 
is no further information available on the distribution of X.  A meaningful upper
limit for the probability that a realization of X lies outside the interval from -3 to 15 
is found by a reformulation of the earlier given form of Chebyshev’s inequality:
In this example, the interval is [−3; 15] symmetrical around the expected value. It 
must have the value 𝑘𝑘 = 3, so that the interval limits are defined as 𝜇𝜇−𝑘𝑘𝜎𝜎 = −3
and 𝜇𝜇 + 𝑘𝑘𝜎𝜎 = 15. It follows:

VI. Binomial Distribution
The Binomial distribution is based on the Bernoulli experiment, which is
characterized by the following properties:
• The experiment consists of a sequence of consecutive trials.
• In each trial, there are two possible outcomes A and B, with the probabilities 
π and (1− π), respectively. 
• The individual trials are statistically independent of each other
(e.g., sequence of n coin tosses).
Then, the probability of x times occurring the event A, and thus, (n − x) times the 
event B in n independent repetitions of the Bernoulli-experiment, is determined 
with the help of the Binomial distribution.
18


--- Slide 19 of 41 ---

Methods: Statistics (Spring 2021)
Multiplication Rule (independence of events):
• Probability of x times occurring A:
P(‚x-times A‘) = P(A)�P(A)� ... �P(A) = (P(A))x = π x
• Correspondingly, the probability of the occurrence B:
(n − x)-times B‘ = (1 − π )n − x
Due to the multiplication rule for independent events, the following applies to the 
occurrence of a particular sequence:
P(,x-times A‘; ,(n − x)-times B,) = π x (1 − π )n − x
with      possible sequences, in which event A happens x times.

An experiment, in which either A occurs with probability P(A) = π or B with
probability P(B) = 1 - π, is independently repeated n times. 
The random variable X states the number of random experiments 
resulting in A, and follows a Binomial distribution. This distribution has the 
following probability function:
Expected value: 𝜇𝜇 = 𝐸𝐸 𝑥𝑥 = 𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛
Variance: 𝜎𝜎2 = 𝐸𝐸 𝑥𝑥 −𝜇𝜇 2 = 𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛 1 −𝑛𝑛

VII. Hypergeometric Distribution

The Hypergeometric distribution models the number of successes in a given 
number of consecutive trials. However:
• The consecutive trials are NOT independent of each other.
• The probability of success changes from one trial to the next (selected 
objects are not returned to population).

VIII. Poisson Distribution
The Poisson distribution is applied to events for which the probability of 
occurrence over a given span is extremely small.
In numerous applications, which formally base on a Bernoulli experiment, the
probability that an event A may occur in a single experiment is very low. In such
cases it is beneficial to approximate the Binomial distribution by a distribution that
results when π → 0 and n →∞, in such a way that the expected value λ = nπ
stays constant. It holds:

Methods: Statistics (Spring 2021)
A discrete random variable X with the probability function
Is called Poisson-distributed with the parameter λ. P(X=x) is the probability that 
the event will occur exactly x times within a given time period. The expected 
value and the variance of a Poisson distribution are equal:
Expected value = Variance = λ
The Poisson distribution is usually used when n and 𝑛𝑛 are not known individually, 
but only the mean value λ = 𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛 and 𝑛𝑛 is very small (< 0.05 according to Weiers).

For small default probabilities of the loans, the frequency of default risk can be

VIII. Approximation of the Binomial Distribution
The Poisson distribution is usually used when n and π are not known individually, 
but the mean value 𝜆𝜆 = nπ is known.
In practice, the Binomial distribution can be approximated by the Poisson 
distribution for sufficiently large n and sufficiently small π (rule of thumb by 
Weiers: n ≥ 20, π≤ 0.05 or by Schira: n ≥ 100, π ≤ 0.10).

I. Basic Idea
Regression analysis examines whether variables are related to each other and 
in which direction this relationship goes. It extends the analysis of variance and is 
often used for predictions in forecasts or choice models.
One examines whether the change of one variable (x) leads to a change of 
another variable (y) (causal relationship):
• xk = Independent variable, predictor variable (k = 1,2,...,K)
• y = Dependent variable, target variable
Regression analysis is divided according to the number of involved predictors:
• Simple Regression with K = 1
• Multiple Regression with K > 1

II. Correlation vs. Regression
Correlation analysis:
The relationship between the metric variable x and the metric variable y is
investigated (non-directional relationship).
Regression analysis:
The influence of the metric or dummy-coded variable x
1 and possible further 
variables xk on the metric variable y is investigated (directional relationship).

Methods: Statistics (Spring 2022) 
II. Correlation vs. Regression
In contrast to correlation analysis, regression analysis allows the examination of
dependencies between two (or more) metrically scaled variables. (exception:
dummy-coded variables).
There is an assumed cause-effect relationship between x and y, where x is the
cause and y is the effect. Variable y is therefore dependent on variable x. This
relationship is described as follows:
y = f (x)
The reasoning for this cause-effect relationship is not derived from regression 
analysis but from theory (e.g., from an economic, behavioral theory).

III. Basic Model (Introductory Example)
Income and food expenses:
An economic theory describes the relationship between the weekly income and
food expenditure of students. With the help of a regression analysis, the strength
and form of this relationship could be determined. The following questions,
among others, should be clarified:
• Is there a significant relationship between income and food expenditure?
• Can the variance in weekly income explain the variance in food expenditure?
• How do food expenses increase when the weekly income rises by 100 CHF?
• What food expenses should a student with a weekly income of 500 CHF have?

with an income of x = 1000 CHF.

III. Basic Model
The random error in this regression model is given as :
𝑛𝑛𝑖𝑖 = 𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖 −𝐸𝐸 𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖 𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖 = 𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖 − 𝛽𝛽1−𝛽𝛽2𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖
This results in the following assumptions and the simple linear regression model 
can be written as follows:
• Assumption 1:     𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖 = 𝛽𝛽1+ 𝛽𝛽2𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖 + 𝑛𝑛𝑖𝑖
• Assumption 2:     𝐸𝐸 𝑛𝑛𝑖𝑖 𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖 = 0
• Assumption 3:     Var(𝑛𝑛𝑖𝑖|𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖) = 𝜎𝜎2
• Assumption 4:     Cov 𝑛𝑛𝑖𝑖, 𝑛𝑛𝑗𝑗 𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖, 𝑥𝑥𝑗𝑗 = 0 for 𝐸𝐸 ≠ 𝑗𝑗
• Assumption 5:     𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖, … , 𝑥𝑥𝑛𝑛 are random and not all the same.
• Assumption 6:     𝑛𝑛𝑖𝑖, … , 𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛 are normally distributed.

III. Method of Ordinary Least Squares (OLS)
Mathematically, the OLS estimates 𝑏𝑏1 and 𝑏𝑏2 for the constant and the slope of the 
true regression model are based on the OLS residuals.
True regression model: 𝐸𝐸 𝑦𝑦 𝑥𝑥 = 𝛽𝛽1 + 𝛽𝛽2𝑥𝑥
Estimated regression model: �𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖 = 𝑏𝑏1 + 𝑏𝑏2𝑥𝑥
OLS residuals: ̂𝑛𝑛𝑖𝑖 = 𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖 − �𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖 = 𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖 − 𝑏𝑏1−𝑏𝑏2𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖
The residual sum of squares is minimized. The sum of squares is used because 
the residuals can be positive or negative.

the food expenditure of students, a sample is collected at the HSG. 40 students
state their income and food expenses per week.

IV. Goodness of Fit
However, the question arises as to how well the OLS estimate resembles the true 
regression line. The variance decomposition gives an indication:

IV. Goodness of Fit
Based on the variance decomposition, the coefficient of determination R2
measures the proportion of the variation in the dependent variable that is explained
by the regression model. R2 only assumes values between 0 and 1.
The coefficient of determination R2 can be interpreted as the share of dispersion
of the y-values that is explained by the regression. For example, the R2 = 0.37
in the previous regression means that 37% of the dispersion in weekly food
expenditures of students can be explained by the linear dependency on income.

IV. Goodness of Fit
To check whether the regression model is significant overall, an F-test* can be
used. This test checks whether the prediction of the dependent variable is improved
by adding the independent variable (𝐻𝐻0: 𝛽𝛽2 = 0, slope test). Hence, it clarifies
whether the model as a whole has explanatory power.
Mean Square Regression:
Mean Square Error: 
The calculated F-Ratio is then compared with the critical value Fc, which follows an 
F-distribution with 1 and n - 2 degrees of freedom. If the F-Ratio exceeds the critical 
value, the model is significant and the linear relationship can be confirmed.

V. Properties of OLS Estimators
The OLS estimators are random variables with means and variances. If
assumptions 1 to 5 hold, then the following applies:
𝐸𝐸(𝑏𝑏1) = 𝛽𝛽1 Var(𝑏𝑏1) =
𝜎𝜎2 ∑𝑖𝑖=1
𝑛𝑛 𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖
2
𝑛𝑛∑𝑖𝑖=1
𝑛𝑛 (𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖− ̅𝑥𝑥)2
𝐸𝐸(𝑏𝑏2) = 𝛽𝛽2 Var(𝑏𝑏2) =
𝜎𝜎2
∑𝑖𝑖=1
𝑛𝑛 (𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖− ̅𝑥𝑥)2
and Cov 𝑏𝑏1, 𝑏𝑏2 = 𝜎𝜎2[ − ̅𝑥𝑥
∑𝑖𝑖=1
𝑛𝑛 (𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖− ̅𝑥𝑥)2]
According to the Gauss-Markov Theorem, this means that the OLS estimators
𝑏𝑏1 and 𝑏𝑏2 have the smallest variance of all linear and unbiased estimators of 𝛽𝛽1
and 𝛽𝛽2. They are BLUE (Best Linear Unbiased Estimators).
The Gauss-Markov Theorem does not depend on assumption 6. If assumption 6 
does happen to hold, the OLS estimators are also normally distributed.
23


--- Slide 24 of 26 ---

Methods: Statistics (Spring 2022) 
V. Variance of OLS estimators
In practice, the error variance is unknown, which means the variances of the
OLS estimators are also unknown. An unbiased estimator of the error variance is
given as follows:
�𝜎𝜎2 = ∑𝑖𝑖=1
𝑛𝑛 (𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖 − �𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖)2
𝑛𝑛−2 = ∑𝑖𝑖=1
𝑛𝑛 ̂𝑛𝑛𝑖𝑖
2
𝑛𝑛−2
Therefore, the estimated variances of the OLS estimators are:
�Var(𝑏𝑏1) =
�𝜎𝜎2 ∑𝑖𝑖=1
𝑛𝑛 𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖
2
𝑛𝑛∑𝑖𝑖=1
𝑛𝑛 (𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖− ̅𝑥𝑥)2
�Var(𝑏𝑏2) =
�𝜎𝜎2
∑𝑖𝑖=1
𝑛𝑛 (𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖− ̅𝑥𝑥)2
The square roots of the estimated variances are called the standard errors.

VI. Confidence Intervals and t-Tests for OLS Estimators
If assumptions 1 to 6 are met, confidence intervals for the OLS estimators can be 
calculated as follows:
𝐸𝐸 = 𝑏𝑏𝑘𝑘−𝛽𝛽𝑘𝑘
𝑠𝑠𝑏𝑏𝑘𝑘
∼ 𝐸𝐸𝑛𝑛−2 for k= 1, 2
𝑏𝑏𝑘𝑘 ± 𝐸𝐸𝑐𝑐𝑠𝑠𝑏𝑏𝑘𝑘
The critical value 𝐸𝐸𝑐𝑐 is determined based on the significance level α and can be
found in the table of the t-distribution. It should be pointed out that we have 𝑛𝑛−2
degrees of freedom, which is the sample size minus the total number of
independent variables minus 1.
It is also possible to create one-tailed and two-tailed t-tests for the OLS
estimators with the t-statistics stated above. The procedure of hypothesis testing
remains the same as in the previous lectures.

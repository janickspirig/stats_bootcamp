Learning Objectives
After this lecture, you know how: 
• to transform a verbal statement into appropriate null and alternative
hypotheses, including the determination of whether a two-tailed test 
or a one-tailed test is appropriate. 
• to describe what is meant by Type I and Type II errors and explain 
how their probabilities can be reduced in hypothesis testing. 
• to carry out a hypothesis test for a population mean or a 
population proportion and interpret the results of the test. 
• to explain the p-value for a hypothesis test and distinguish it from the 
level of significance α.

I. Introduction Example
Cola Zero vs. Original:
Two students do not agree whether Cola Zero tastes as good as the Original
(assumption). For this reason, they carry out a blind test (random sample) where
20 fellow students are asked to taste both versions. If Cola Zero tastes as good as
the Original, Cola Zero should be chosen in approximately 50% of the cases
(chance level).
However, the test shows that in total 8 students (8/20 = 40%) prefer Cola Zero.
• Can you infer that Cola Zero does not taste as good as the original?
• Does this value still lie in a range of statistical chance?

I. Basic Idea
Facts or questions such as the previous introductory example can be answered by
using the concepts of test theory. The statement about the population is precisely
formulated by the null hypotheses and the contrary statement is given by the
alternative hypotheses.
Cola Zero vs. Original:
Null hypothesis (H0):
In 50% of the cases Cola Zero is preferred as it tastes equally good.
Alternative hypothesis (H1): 
Cola Zero is not preferred in 50% of cases as it does not tastes equally good.

Methods: Statistics (Spring 2022) 
I. Basic Idea
The hypothesis test (significance test) assesses the validity of these hypotheses
by drawing a conclusion from the sample to the population. The following
assumptions are important:
• The null hypothesis is valid ("the benefit of the doubt ").
• The data are collected by means of a random sample.
There is always the risk of a false conclusion as the decision of the hypothesis test
is based on only one sample. This risk is denoted by the significance level α,
which has to be determined subjectively and before the test is conducted.
As part of the hypothesis test, a test statistic (z or t) is assigned to the drawn
sample. The test statistic is subsequently evaluated in order to conclude whether 
or not H0 should be rejected.

--- Slide 8 of 30 ---

Methods: Statistics (Spring 2022) 
I. Basic Idea
The evaluation of the test statistic is done by consulting a suitable (and already
known) test distribution. In case the test statistic is located at one of the two tails
of the test distribution (i.e., if it exceeds a critical value) H0 can be rejected.
The entirety of all possible test values is thus divided into an area where H0 is
rejected and one where H0 is not rejected. This partitioning is determined by the
selected level of significance.
• If the test statistic falls into the acceptance region of H0, H0 is not rejected
• If the test statistic does not fall into the acceptance region of H0, it is 
regarded as being statistically significant and H0 is rejected.

II. Null and Alternative Hypothesis
A hypothesis can either be formulated two-tailed (non-directional) or one-tailed
(directional), with one-tailed hypotheses being either left-tailed or right-tailed.
Cola Zero vs. Original:
Two-tailed hypothesis: 
Cola Zero is preferred in 50% of cases. 
H0: π = 0.50, H1: π ≠ 0.50
One-tailed, left-tailed hypothesis: 
Cola Zero is preferred in at least 50% of cases. 
H0: π ≥ 0.50, H1: π < 0.50
One-tailed, right-tailed hypothesis: 
Cola Zero is preferred in a maximum of 50% of cases. 
H0: π ≤ 0.50, H1: π > 0.50

IV. Procedure of Hypothesis Testing
In hypothesis testing there are five steps to follow:
1. Formulation of the null and alternative hypothesis
as well as selection of the significance level
2. Selection of an appropriate test statistic and test distribution,
assuming validity of the null hypothesis
3. Determination of the critical value(s)
4. Calculation of the test statistic
5. Decision and interpretation

Welding robot:
A properly adjusted welding robot needs on average 1.3250 minutes for a
particular weld seam. Previous experiences show that the standard deviation of
one cycle is 0.0396 minutes. A randomly drawn sample of 80 cycles exhibits a
sample mean of 1.3229 minutes. Should the robot be readjusted based on a
hypothesis test (significance level α = 0.05)?
1. Hypotheses and significance levels:
H0: μ = 1.3250; H1: μ ≠ 1.3250; α = 0.05

3. Critical value(s):
Two-tailed hypothesis test with α = 0.05 → zα/2 = ± 1.96
4. Calculation of the test statistic:
5. Decision and interpretation:
Since the test variable z = -0.47 lies within the range of zα/2 = ± 1.96, H0 cannot
be rejected at a significance level of 5%. Hence, it cannot be concluded from
the test result that the robot should be readjusted.

Lightbulbs:
A factory’s light bulbs have an average life of 1,030 hours with a standard deviation
of 90 hours. An engineer designs a new feature to prolong the life of lightbulbs.
However, the production manager fears that this is not the case. Therefore, he
tests 40 randomly drawn lightbulbs with the new feature which has an average life
of 1,061.6 hours. Should the procuction manager use the new feature in the future
(significance level α = 0.05)?

3. Critical value(s):
One-tailed, right-tailed hypothesis test with α = 0.05 → zα = 1.645
4. Calculation of the test statistic:
5. Decision and interpretation:
As the test statistic z = 2.22 is above the critical value zα = 1.645, H0 can be
rejected at a significance level of 5%. It follows, that the device actually
extends the life of light bulbs (based on the sample).

Construction company:
A firm produces panels with a target thickness of 0.25 cm on average. The panel 
thickness is normally distributed. A sample of 10 panels exhibits a mean of 0.253 
cm and a standard deviation of 0.003 cm. Test the hypothesis that the machine is 
working accurately at a significance level of α = 0.05. Note that the population 
standard deviation is not known!

3. Critical value(s):

4. Calculation of the test statistic:
5. Decision and interpretation:
The null hypothesis H0 can be rejected at a significance level of 5% as the test
statistic t = 3,162 is above the critical value tα/2 = 2,262. This is the proof that
the machine is not working accurately.

VI. Test Statistic for the Proportion (Example)
Graduate survey:
A university claims that 70% of graduates get their first employment in a position
directly related to their undergraduate field of study. A survey among 200 recent
graduates shows that 66% get an employment that is directly related to their
undergraduate field of study. Can the university's statement be confirmed by using
a hypothesis test with a significance level of 0.05?
1. Hypotheses and significance levels:
H0: π = 0.70; H1: π ≠ 0.70; α = 0.05

As z = -1.23 lies within the range zα/2 = ± 1.96, the statement of the university
(H0) cannot be rejected. Therefore, it can be assumed that approximately 70% 
of graduates find a job within 3 months after graduation.

VII. Type I and Type II Error
A hypothesis tests draws the right conclusion about the population in the
following two cases:
• H0 is wrong and is rejected.
• H0 is true and is not rejected.
However, there is always the danger of error. A wrong conclusion about the
population results if H0 is true and is rejected (Type I error) and if H0 is wrong and
is not rejected (Type II error):
The significance level α indicates the probability of a Type I error, while β reflects
the probability of a Type II error. In hypothesis testing, there is a necessary trade-
off between Type I and Type II errors. 28

VIII. p-Value
Besides the described procedure of hypothesis testing, in which the test statistic is
compared with the critical value(s), one can test a hypothesis also by means of the
p-value (empirical significance level).
The p-value is calculated from the sample (usually via statistical software) and
assumes values between 0 and 1. The p-value indicates the probability of
obtaining a result that is equal to (or more extreme than) what was observed,
even though the null hypothesis is true. Thus, the p-value indicates how
extreme a result is: the smaller the p-value, the stronger the evidence against H0
(and the stronger the evidence in favor of H1).
The p-value corresponds to the area which is described by the corresponding
distribution function and the interval [xtest; ∞]. H0 is discarded if the p-value is
smaller than the significance level.

Methods: Statistics (Spring 2021) 
I. Basic Terms
Random experiment: A process that is performed according to certain
rules, can be repeated an arbitrary number of times, and whose result
depends on chance (e.g., the number of dots (pips) after throwing a dice).
Elementary events: Each random experiment has several possible
elementary results. When the experiment is performed, exactly one of
them occurs.
Sample space: set of all possible elementary events of the experiment 
(e.g., throwing of a cube has the sample space = {1,2,3,4,5,6}).

I. Basic Terms
(Composed) events: Any possible subset of the sample space (including ). An
event occurs when an included elementary event occurs.
Example: ‚Even number‘ when throwing a
dice is a (composed) event consisting of the
elementary events ‚2‘, ‚4‘ and ‚6‘.

Probability: A number between 0 and 1 
assigned to an event and representing 
the probability of the event occurring.
Complementary event: The complementary event of an event A is the event „not 
A“. It is defined as the set of all elementary events of the sample space which are
not included in A. We write:

--- Slide 9 of 41 ---

Methods: Statistics (Spring 2021) 
II. Classical Approach
The classical approach goes back to P.S. Laplace (1749-1827) and 
defines probability as the proportion of times that an event can be 
expected to occur in a random experiment.
P(A)= number of favourable outcomes
total number of possible outcomes
Example 1: for a 6-sided dice, the probability that 3 occurs:
P(A=3) = 1
1+1+1+1+1+1

II. Relative Frequency Approach
lim ( )nn
fA
→
The relative frequency approach is empirically based on the law of large 
numbers and corresponds to the frequency with which an event occurs 
with a correspondingly large number of trials. The propability (P) is then
equal to the limit value of the relative frequency of occurrence of A.
P(A)= number of trials in which A occurs
total number of trials
resp.: P(A) = 
with ∙ (number of trials in which A occurred)

II. Relative Frequency Approach

Example: The life insurance industry uses relative frequencies to calculate
acceptability and premium for applicants. With a death rate of 221.77 (per 1000 
male persons aged 90), the probability of death within the next year for a 90-
year-old policyholder is 0.22. 
Example «Coin Tossing»: With a growing number of trials (N tosses) the
probability to get ‚heads‘ will approach 0.5 .
P(head) = # of heads

--- Slide 13 of 41 ---

Methods: Statistics (Spring 2021) 
II. Subjective Approach
The approach is judgemental and reflects the degreee to which one believes
that an event will happen or not. Subjective probabilities can be quantified by
expressing odds (likelihood that something will happen).
1. If the quota for a certain event is A : B, then the probability reads:
2. If the probability for a certain event is x (with 0x1), the corresponding
quota reads:

II. Axiomatic Approach
15
Generalization:
• The axiomatic approach goes back to Kolmogorov.
• The axiomatic approach does not explain the character of probability, but it
defines its mathematical properties.
• According to Kolmogorov, sets can be interpreted as events to which a 
probability p can be assigned.
A function P defined on a system of events is called probability, if it fulfills the
Kolmogorovian axioms.

III. Axioms of Kolmogorov
• The probability P(A) of an event A is a definite, non-negative real number 
between the values 0 and 1.
0  P(A)  1
• The safe event has the probability 1.
P() = 1  with  = {A1, A2, ... , An}
• For two disjoint events A1, A2 with (A1  A2 = ) it holds:
P(A1  A2) = P(A1) + P(A2)
16


--- Slide 17 of 41 ---

Methods: Statistics (Spring 2021) 
III. Axioms of Kolmogorov
• For each event A it holds
P(A) = 1 - P(A)
• Probability of the impossible event :
P() = 1 − P() = 0
• Generalization on n mutually exclusive events A1, A2, ..., An yields:
 P(A1  A2  ....  An) = P(A1) + P(A2) + ... + P(An)

The events are mutually exclusive: Let A and B be arbitrary events of a random
experiment. The probability for the event AB can be calculated by summing up
P(A) and P(B). 
The events are not mutually exclusive: The probability of the event AB can be
calculated by summing up P(A) and P(B). However, in doing so the area AB is
counted twice. Thus, it has to be subtracted again:

Number of elements in the state space: 52 
An elementary event (a particular card) has the probability of 1/52.
It follows: P(Q ) = 4/52 + 13/52 - 1/52 = 16/52
 P(Q) = 4/52.
P() = 13/52.
P(  Q) = 1/52.

VI. Conditional probability
Occasionally, one is interested in the occurence of certain events conditional on 
other events. P(B | A) is the conditional probability that event B occurs given that 
the event A has already occurred.
P(B | A) Conditional probability of event B given A
P(AB) Joint probability of events A and B
P(A)       Marginal probability of event A (with P(A) > 0): 
P(B | A) = P(AB) / P(A) Sample space

A  B B

--- Slide 26 of 41 ---

Methods: Statistics (Spring 2021) 
Sometimes the probabilities P(B | A) and P(A) are known, while the probability
P(A  B) is to be calculated. For this, the multiplication rule can be used. The
equation follows from the conditional probability formula.
P(A  B) = P(B | A) ∙ P(A)
P(A  B) = P(A | B) ∙ P(B)
Dependent events: The occurrence of one event affects the probability of the 
occurrence of another event.
Independent events: The occurrence of one event has no influence on the 
probability of occurrence of the other event.
For independent events: P(A  B) = P(A) ∙ P(B)
Events A and B are stochastically independent if:
P(B | A) = P(B | ഥ𝑨) = P(B) oder P(A | B) = P(A | ഥ𝑩) = P(A)

VII. Tree Diagrams (Example)
What is the probability of the price of a security to rise today and tomorrow?
P( today) = P( today) = 0.5 
Probability "  tomorrow" is 0.6 if the stock has risen today. Thus, the conditional 
probability is given by:
P( tomorrow |  today) = 0.6 
27
 tomorrow
 today,  tomorrow P( tomorrow |  today) = F2 | F1 = 0.6
P( today and  tomorrow) 
= P( tomorrow |  today) ∙ P( today) 
= 0.6 x 0.5 = 0.3

F1 P( today)

Tree diagrams visually summarize the occurrence or non-occurrence of two or
more events. They are especially useful for events that occur in sequence. The 
probabilities of the possible events on each step are plotted at the branches.

VII. Tree Diagram
Analogous:
P( today,  tomorrow) = P( today) ∙ P( tomorrow |  today)
P( tomorrow |  today) = 1 - P( tomorrow |  today) = 0.4
P( today,  tomorrow) = 0.5 ∙ 0.4 = 0.2
29
P( today,  tomorrow) = P( today) ∙ P( tomorrow |  today)
P( tomorrow | today ) = 1 - P( tomorrow |  today) = 0.4
P( today,  tomorrow) = 0.5 ∙ 0.4 = 0.2

= P( today,  tomorrow) + P( today,  tomorrow)
→The two events " today,  tomorrow" and " today,  tomorrow" are mutually
exclusive. Therefore, the probabilities can be added together.
That's why:
= P( today,  tomorrow) + P( today,  tomorrow)

Methods: Statistics (Spring 2021) 
Appendix: Combinatorics
Combinatorics analyzes in how many different ways a given number of elements
can be arranged and combined. The topic of combinatorics is closely related to
the concept of probability. Mostly we are interested in different combinations of
possible events and the determination of the corresponding probability of
randomly choosing a particular combination. It is important that the postulation of
equal probabilities is fulfilled.
Permutations refer to the number of different ways in which objects can be
arranged in order. Each item can appear only once and each order of
arrangement is a separate permutation. Combinations consider the possible set
of objects independent of the order in which the objects are arranged.

Special cases: 1! = 1
0! ∶= 1
Principle of multiplication: if there are m ways a first event can happen and n
ways in which a second event can happen, the total number of possibilities is 𝑚∙𝑛
• Following an event that can happen in n1 ways, the second event can happen 
n2 ways, the total number of both ways can happen is n1n2
• If each of k independent events can occur in n different ways, the total number 
of possibilities is nk

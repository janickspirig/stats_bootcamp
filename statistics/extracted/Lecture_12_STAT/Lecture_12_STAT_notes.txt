I. Basic Model (Introductory Example)
Fast food chain:
A fast-food company wants to investigate its hamburger sales empirically. The
managing director reads about an economic theory that the price and the
advertising expenditures have a major impact on the hamburger turnover. Among
others, he asks himself the following questions:
• Do hamburger sales increase with higher advertising expenditure?
• If yes, do the higher sales compensate for increased advertising expenditures?
• Does a reduction of the price lead to an increase in sales or a loss of turnover? 
Are hamburger sales price-inelastic or price-elastic?

I. Basic Model
A relationship between a dependent variable and several independent variables,
such as the introductory example, can be examined closely by using OLS in a
multiple regression analysis. This results in the following assumptions and the
multiple regression model can be written as:
• Assumption 1: 𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖 = 𝛽𝛽1+ 𝛽𝛽2𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖2 + 𝛽𝛽3𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖3 + ⋯+ 𝛽𝛽𝐾𝐾𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝑒𝑒𝑖𝑖
• Assumption 2: 𝐸𝐸 𝑒𝑒𝑖𝑖 𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖 = 0 where 𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖 = (𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖2, 𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖3,…, 𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖)′
• Assumption 3: Var(𝑒𝑒𝑖𝑖|𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖) = 𝜎𝜎2
• Assumption 4: Cov 𝑒𝑒𝑖𝑖, 𝑒𝑒𝑗𝑗 𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖, 𝑥𝑥𝑗𝑗 = 0 for 𝑖𝑖 ≠ 𝑗𝑗
• Assumption 5: 𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖, … , 𝑥𝑥𝑛𝑛 are random and there is no exact linear               
relationship among any of the independent variables.
• Assumption 6: 𝑒𝑒𝑖𝑖, … , 𝑒𝑒𝑛𝑛 are normally distributed.

I. Basic Model
Therefore, in a multiple regression model there are multiple slope coefficients.
These coefficients are always interpreted individually. For example, 𝛽𝛽𝑖𝑖 measures
the effect of the change in the independent variable 𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖 on the expected value
of y if all other variables are held constant (ceteris paribus).
True regression model: 𝐸𝐸 𝑦𝑦 𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖2, … , 𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝛽𝛽1 + 𝛽𝛽2𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖2 + ⋯+ 𝛽𝛽𝐾𝐾𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖
Estimated regression model: �𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖 = 𝑏𝑏1 + 𝑏𝑏2𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖2 + 𝑏𝑏3𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖3 + ⋯+ 𝑏𝑏𝐾𝐾𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖
OLS residuals: ̂𝑒𝑒𝑖𝑖 = 𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖 − �𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖 = 𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖 −𝑏𝑏1 −𝑏𝑏2𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖2 −⋯−𝑏𝑏𝐾𝐾𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖
The OLS estimates of the coefficients are obtained by minimizing* the residual 
sum of squares as with simple regression.

* Solving the first-order conditions for a minimum yields messy expressions for the least squares
estimators, even when K is small. Morover, it requires complex linear algebra and matrix notation.

I. Basic Model (Introductory Example, R-Example 1)
The managing director now wants to empirically investigate the influence of price
and advertising expenditure on hamburger sales. Therefore, the fast food chain
offers burgers in 75 cities at different prices, varies advertising expenditure in each
city and measures the sales figures. This cross-sectional sample looks as follows:

II. Goodness of Fit
The coefficient of determination R2 either remains the same or improves when
adding a further independent variable (even if it has no economic justification).
Hence, in the case of multiple regression, R2 does not allow for a fair comparison
of different regression models.
However, the Adjusted R2 overcomes this weakness by including the sample size
and the number of independent variables in the calculation. In contrast to the
quality measure R2, the Adjusted R2 can also decrease with the addition of
variables with little or no explanatory content (penalization). This allows a fair
comparison of different models.
The Adjusted R2 should not be used as a criterion for adding or deleting
variables in the regression model!

Methods: Statistics (Spring 2021) 
II. Goodness of Fit
In the case of a multiple regression, an F-test can also be used to check whether
the regression model is significant overall. It checks whether the prediction of the
dependent variable is improved by adding an independent variable (slope test). In
the case of multiple regressions, however, the calculation changes slightly:
Mean Square Regression:
Mean Square Error: 
The calculated F-Ratio is then compared with the critical value Fc, which follows a
F-distribution with k and n - k -1 degrees of freedom. If the F-Ratio exceeds the
critical value, the null hypothesis (𝐻𝐻0: 𝛽𝛽2 = 𝛽𝛽3 = ⋯ = 𝛽𝛽𝐾𝐾 = 0) can be rejected.
Hence, the model is significant and the linear relationships can be confirmed.

III. Properties of OLS Estimators
In the multiple regression framework, OLS estimators are also random variables
with means and variances. If assumptions 1 to 5 hold, the estimators fulfill the
Gauss-Markov Theorem. 𝑏𝑏1, 𝑏𝑏2, … , 𝑏𝑏𝑖𝑖 then have the smallest variance of all
linear and unbiased estimators of 𝛽𝛽1, 𝛽𝛽2, … , 𝛽𝛽𝑖𝑖 and are BLUE (Best Linear
Unbiased Estimators).*
As the error variance is also unknown in the case of multiple regressions, the true
variance of the coefficients has to be estimated again. The estimated variance
(standard error) of each coefficient has to be derived from error variance
seperately. However, these calculations are messy and are not mentioned in detail.
12
* In the case of multiple regression, the Gauss-Markov Theorem is also not dependent on assumption 6.

Methods: Statistics (Spring 2021) 
VI. Confidence Intervals and t-Tests for OLS Estimators
If assumptions 1 to 6 are met, confidence intervals for the OLS estimators can be
calculated as follows:
𝑡𝑡 =
𝑏𝑏𝑘𝑘−𝛽𝛽𝑘𝑘
𝑠𝑠𝑏𝑏𝑘𝑘
∼ 𝑡𝑡𝑛𝑛−𝑖𝑖 for k= 1, … , 𝑘𝑘
𝑏𝑏𝑖𝑖 ± 𝑡𝑡𝑐𝑐𝑠𝑠𝑏𝑏𝑘𝑘
The critical value 𝑡𝑡𝑐𝑐 is determined based on the significance level α and can be
found in the table of the t-distribution. It should be pointed out that we have 𝑛𝑛−k −
1 degrees of freedom, which is the sample size minus the total number of
independent variables minus one.
It is also possible to create one-tailed and two-tailed t-tests for the OLS
estimators with the t-statistics stated above. The procedure of hypothesis testing
remains the same as in the previous lectures.

V. Dummy Variables (R-Example 2)
House prices:
The price of a house depends on the living space in square feet (SQFT). However,
a broker suspects that this relationship could be influenced by the presence of a
pool. Therefore, he would like to investigate this relationship empirically and takes
a sample of 1000 house sales in a city. In addition to price and living space, this
sample collects a variable which measures whether the house has a pool or not.
This variable is called a dummy variable which reflects the respective categories
(no pool, pool) with the values 0 and 1:
POOLi = 0 if house i has no pool
POOLi = 1 if house i has a pool
Dummy variables are often included in different ways in regression models and 
can, therefore, measure different effects.

V. Dummy Variables (R-Example 2)
19
When interpreting regression models with dummy variables, the reference group
is particularly important. The reference group is corresponds to 𝐷𝐷𝑖𝑖 = 0. For
example, in the house price model:
�𝑃𝑃𝑅𝑅𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝐸𝐸𝑖𝑖 = 29.68 + 5.69𝑷𝑷𝑷𝑷𝑷𝑷𝑷𝑷𝒊𝒊 + 8.60𝑀𝑀𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑖𝑖 + 𝑒𝑒𝑖𝑖
the reference group are houses with no pool (POOLi = 0). Two alternative models:
�𝑃𝑃𝑅𝑅𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝐸𝐸𝑖𝑖 = 35.37 −5.69𝑵𝑵𝑷𝑷𝑷𝑷𝑷𝑷𝑷𝑷𝑷𝑷𝒊𝒊 + 8.60𝑀𝑀𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑖𝑖 + 𝑒𝑒𝑖𝑖
�𝑃𝑃𝑅𝑅𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝐸𝐸𝑖𝑖 = 29.68𝑵𝑵𝑷𝑷𝑷𝑷𝑷𝑷𝑷𝑷𝑷𝑷𝒊𝒊 + 35.37𝑷𝑷𝑷𝑷𝑷𝑷𝑷𝑷𝒊𝒊 + 8.60𝑀𝑀𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑖𝑖 + 𝑒𝑒𝑖𝑖
In these two models it holds that NOPOOLi = 1 - POOLi. Note: We cannot include
both POOLi and NOPOOLi in a model containing a constant term because the two
variables are perfectly collinear. This error is known as the dummy variable trap.

VI. Non-Linearity
20
Not all relationships between variables are linear. However, if these non-linear
relationships are described by a linear regression model, violations of
assumptions 2 (𝐸𝐸 𝑒𝑒𝑖𝑖 𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖 = 0) and 3 (Cov 𝑒𝑒𝑖𝑖, 𝑒𝑒𝑗𝑗 𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖, 𝑥𝑥𝑗𝑗 = 0) are the result. The
expected value and the variance of the residuals (left) do not correspond to the
assumed case (right).
Non-linearities can only be solved with a new specification of the regression model 
(e.g., logarithmic and quadratic transformations).

VI. Non-Linearity

The following graphs show a perfect linear relationship and two perfect non-linear 
relationships in a regression model with two independent variables.


--- Slide 22 of 24 ---

Methods: Statistics (Spring 2021) 
In case of a violation of assumption 3 (Var(𝑒𝑒𝑖𝑖|𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖) = 𝜎𝜎2), heteroscedasticity is
present. One refers to heteroscedasticity (vs. homoscedasticity) if the variance of
the residuals increases or decreases over xi.
Heteroskeedasticity is problematic as it leads to a wrong estimation of the
standard errors of the coefficients. Hence, the statistical significance of the
estimators is distorted and as a result hypothesis tests and confidence intervals
are biased.

VI. Autocorrelation
23
In the case of autocorrelation, assumption 4 (Cov 𝑒𝑒𝑖𝑖, 𝑒𝑒𝑗𝑗 𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖, 𝑥𝑥𝑗𝑗 = 0) is violated. 
The residuals in one period are correlated with the residuals in another period. 
This problem occurs mainly with time series data.
The graph on the right illustrates autocorrelation. In contrast to the graph on the 
left, the residuals are correlated with each other (linear pattern). Hence, similar to
heteroskedasticity, the significance of OLS estimators is incorrectly assessed.

Methods: Statistics (Spring 2021) 
VI. Multicollinearity
24
In the case of multiple regressions one has to ensure that no perfect
multicollinearity is present, which would violate assumption 5.
Perfect multicollinearity occurs when there is an exact linear relationship
between two or more independent variables. Weak multicollinearity occurs when
two independent variables are highly correlated but do not determine each other
(e.g., dummy variables for lipstick users and a dummy variable for gender).
However, multicollinearity is not a major problem. In the case of perfect
multicollinearity, the superfluous independent variables are simply dropped from
the analysis. In the case of weak multicollinearity, the standard errors increase,
which could be compensated by a larger sample size.

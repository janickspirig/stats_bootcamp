Methods: Statistics (Spring 2022) 
I. Estimates from Samples
The unknown population parameters should be estimated based on the result of
a sample. Two types of estimation procedures exist : point estimates and
interval estimates.
A point estimate results in a single estimated value for the parameter of interest
based on the sample result (sample statistic). A point estimator is unbiased if the
expected value of the sample statistic equals the value of the population
parameter of interest.
Since the realizations of the sample are random, the point estimate for the
population is uncertain. To be able to make statements about the "degree of
uncertainty", an interval estimate is derived (range within which the actual value
may fall). Based on a sample, a confidence interval is stated that encloses the
population parameter of interest with a specified probability.

distributed population or a sufficiently large sample size (n ≥ 30, central limit
theorem):

With respect to the "not-standardized" distribution, the last equation becomes:
With probability (1) the sample mean is realized in the so-called probability 
interval:
However, an estimation aims at finding a confidence interval for
, the true but
unknown population mean. In the following, two cases are distinguished:
1. population variance 
 2 known.
2.  population variance

Based on the definition of the probability interval 
a transformation of its boundaries is performed:
This leads to the new equation
which defines the so-called confidence interval that covers the true

The limits of the confidence interval are random (they depend on the random 
variable "sample mean").
Consequently, if a large number of samples is drawn, the confidence interval
covers the population mean in (1  )·100% of the cases. This confidence level
is usually stated by the index at the right bracket.

mean is not known, then the sample variance s2 must be used as estimator
for
2:
As a consequence, the denominator of the standardized test statistics is now also
random. The new test statistics T is no longer normally distributed. It follows a
t-distribution with n – 1 degrees of freedom.

Methods: Statistics (Spring 2022) 
The application of the t-distribution requires that the sample mean is normally
distributed.T h i si st h ec a s ei f
• the samples were drawn from a normally distributed population or
• the sample size is large enough: n  30 (CLT, independent of the distribution
of the population).
For other distributions and n <3 0 , the distribution of the sample mean is
generally unknown. Thus the determination of confidence intervals is not
possible (with the approaches introduced here).
III. Student t-distribution

--- Slide 15 of 31 ---

Methods: Statistics (Spring 2022) 
III. Student t-distribution
The shape of the t-distribution is determined by its single parameter, the degree
of freedom (df). With increasing values of this parameter, the t-distribution
converges to the standard normal distribution. Here df = n – 1. As a simplification
the tabulated values from the standard normal distribution may be used if n  30
The t-distribution is only taken when n <3 0 and the population is normally
distributed.

Methods: Statistics (Spring 2022) 
III. Student t-distribution
The t-distribution enables us to construct confidence intervals for the mean when
the sample is small (n < 30) and drawn from a population that is assumed to be
normally distributed, and the variance is unknown.
For other distributions and n < 30, no sufficiently accurate confidence intervals
can be constructed in this way.
With growing n,t h e t-distribution converges to the standardized normal
distribution. The main difference to the normal distribution is that the t-distribution
assigns higher probabilities to the tails. Intuitively, this reflects the higher
uncertainty of the test statistics since s
2 in the denominator is only estimated.

What do the t-distribution and beer have in common?
To produce beer of a consistently high quality, the
the Guinness Brewery investigated brewing beer
scientifically. For this purpose, William Gosset,
a mathematician and statistician, was hired in 1899. 
Since Guinness only had a small budget for research
activities, Gosset only was able to carry out a small number of
experiments. Therefore, Gosset developed the t-distribution out of the necessity 
to work with small samples and an unknown population.
Since Guinness did not allow his staff to publish the research results, Gosset
published his discovery under the pseudonym " Student". To this day, the
t-distribution is known as student's t.

Speed Control:
A random sample of 20 observations was taken from the record of a radar speed
check installed at the city border:
Based on this sample and under the assumption of an approximately normally
distributed population, determine a 90%-confidence interval for the average
speed at the city border.

Methods: Statistics (Spring 2022) 
As 
 is not known and the population is approximately normally distributed, 
the t-distribution is used for the determination of the confidence interval : 
Interpretation: With a probability of 90% the true average speed (the population 
parameter) is covered by an interval from 51.2 to 64.6 km/h.

The width of the confidence interval 2e may be considered as a measure for
the "accuracy" of the estimator. Given a predefined confidence level (1 

V. Sample Size (Example)
Election:
A politician orders a survey to determine the estimated proportion of voters that
will vote for his party at the coming election. What is the necessary sample size if
he wishes the absolute error to be within 3 percentage points of the true
proportion for a confidence level of 95% (1 –  = 0.95; /2 = 0.025, e = 0.03)?
Because ap r i o r ino value for p is given, it is set to p = 0.5 to estimate the
(maximum possible) variance. To obtain the desired width of the confidence
interval, the sample size should be n = 1068 (rounded).

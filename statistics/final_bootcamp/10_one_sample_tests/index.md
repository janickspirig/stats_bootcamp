# Module 10: One-Sample Tests

> 📚 **Overview:** Test claims about a single population mean or proportion using sample data.

Testing claims about a single population parameter.

---

## Learning Objectives

After completing this module, you will be able to:
- Conduct z-tests for means (σ known)
- Conduct t-tests for means (σ unknown)
- Conduct tests for proportions
- Choose the appropriate test for each situation

## Topics in This Module

📄 **[I can perform a z-test for the mean](z_test_mean.md)**
When population standard deviation is known.

📄 **[I can perform a t-test for the mean](t_test_mean.md)**
When population standard deviation is unknown.

📄 **[I can perform a z-test for proportions](z_test_proportion.md)**
Testing claims about population proportions.

## Key Formulas

| Test | Test Statistic | Use When |
|------|----------------|----------|
| Z-test (mean) | $z = \frac{\bar{x} - \mu_0}{\sigma/\sqrt{n}}$ | σ known |
| T-test (mean) | $t = \frac{\bar{x} - \mu_0}{s/\sqrt{n}}$ | σ unknown |
| Z-test (proportion) | $z = \frac{\hat{p} - p_0}{\sqrt{p_0(1-p_0)/n}}$ | Large n |

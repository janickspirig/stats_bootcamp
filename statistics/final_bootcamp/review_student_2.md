# Student Review — HSG BBA Perspective (high-grade oriented)

## Scope
- Reviewed **82** curriculum markdown files in `statistics/final_bootcamp/`.
- Excluded existing review files (not curriculum):
  - `review_student_1.md`
  - `review_student_4.md`
  - `review_student_5.md`

## Executive summary (what will most improve grades)
- **More Übungsblatt-style drill density**: many topics have 1–2 examples; HSG exams reward speed + pattern repetition.
- **Standardize procedures**: every test page should use the same 5-step template + identical notation for α/α/2, df, and decision rule.
- **Surface traps**: explicitly label the frequent errors (SE vs SD, p0 vs p-hat, α vs α/2, df, table lookup).
- **Interpretation practice**: add one “so what?” business sentence after every calculation.

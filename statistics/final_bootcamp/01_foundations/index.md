## 🎯 Learning Objectives

After completing this module, you will be able to:
- Distinguish between different types of data
- Identify and apply the four scales of measurement (NOIR)
- Understand the implications of data types for statistical analysis

---

## Topics in This Module

📄 **[I know the different types of data and their characteristics](data_types.md)**
Primary vs. secondary data, qualitative vs. quantitative data, and their properties.

📄 **[I can identify and distinguish scales of measurement](scales_of_measurement.md)**
Nominal, Ordinal, Interval, and Ratio scales (NOIR) and what operations are valid for each.

## Key Concepts Covered

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Primary Data | Data collected firsthand for a specific purpose |
| Secondary Data | Pre-existing data collected by others |
| Qualitative Data | Categorical, descriptive data |
| Quantitative Data | Numerical, measurable data |
| Nominal Scale | Categories without order |
| Ordinal Scale | Categories with meaningful order |
| Interval Scale | Equal intervals, no true zero |
| Ratio Scale | Equal intervals with true zero |

## Why This Matters

Understanding data types is essential because:
1. **It determines which statistics you can calculate** - You can't compute a mean for nominal data
2. **It affects visualization choices** - Different charts work for different data types
3. **It influences test selection** - Many statistical tests require specific data types

# Student Review 4: HSG BBA Perspective
**Reviewer:** Anonymous HSG BBA Student (3rd semester)  
**Date:** December 2025  
**Background:** Statistics course "Methods: Statistics" (3,120) - Herbstsemester 2024

---

## Executive Summary

As an HSG BBA student preparing for the Methods: Statistics exam, I find this bootcamp to be a solid supplementary resource but it requires significant improvements to achieve optimal learning outcomes and high grades. The content covers the right topics but lacks the business context, calculation precision, and exam-focused structure that HSG students need.

**Overall Rating:** 6.5/10  
**Grade Potential:** Currently supports 4.0-4.5; with improvements could support 5.5-6.0

## 2. Major Areas for Improvement

### 🚨 Lack of Business Relevance
**Current Issue:** Examples are too generic and academic. HSG students need consulting/finance/marketing context.

**Specific Problems:**
- Customer age datasets instead of market research scenarios
- Generic "companies" instead of recognizable Swiss firms (Nestlé, UBS, etc.)
- Missing connection to business decision-making

**HSG Context:** Our program emphasizes practical application for consulting, finance, and management careers.

**Recommendations:**
- Replace generic examples with business cases:
  - Marketing: A/B testing conversion rates for digital campaigns
  - Finance: Risk analysis of investment portfolios
  - Consulting: Customer satisfaction benchmarking for client projects
  - Operations: Quality control in manufacturing processes

### 🚨 Insufficient HSG Exercise Alignment
**Current Issue:** Bootcamp format doesn't match actual Übungsblatt structure.

**Specific Problems:**
- Missing the multi-part "Aufgabe 1, Aufgabe 2" format
- Calculation tables lack the exact column structure HSG expects
- No emphasis on 4-decimal precision for intermediate calculations
- Missing German terminology integration

**HSG Exercise Style (from actual Übungsblätter):**
```
AUFGABE 1 - DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS
Given: x = [12, 15, 18, 14, 12, 22, 16, 14, 12, 85]

a) Calculate Range:
   Range = x_max - x_min = 85 - 12 = 73

b) Build calculation table for MAD:
   | xi | xi - x̄ | |xi - x̄| |
   |----|--------|----------|
   | 12 | -21.4  | 21.4     |
   [...]
   Σ |         | 148.2    |
   MAD = Σ|xi-x̄| / n = 148.2 / 10 = 14.82
```

**Recommendations:**
- Restructure exercises to match HSG format exactly
- Include German column headers in tables
- Emphasize 4-decimal precision for intermediates, 2 decimals for final answers
- Add "Refresher" sections like real Übungsblätter

### 🚨 Weak Business Decision-Making Framework
**Current Issue:** Focus on calculations without connecting to business implications.

**Specific Problems:**
- Missing interpretation sections for business context
- No discussion of "So what?" for managers
- Limited emphasis on statistical vs. practical significance

**HSG Context:** We learn statistics to support business decisions, not just pass exams.

**Recommendations:**
- Add "Business Implications" sections to each worked example
- Include decision-making frameworks:
  ```
  Statistical Result: p = 0.03, reject H₀
  Business Decision: Launch new marketing campaign
  Rationale: Evidence suggests 3% conversion improvement is statistically significant
  Risk Assessment: Consider implementation costs vs. expected ROI
  ```

### 🚨 Insufficient German Terminology Integration
**Current Issue:** No German terms despite exercises being in German.

**Specific Problems:**
- Missing key terms students encounter in Übungsblätter
- No pronunciation guides for Greek letters
- English-only explanations

**HSG Context:** Lectures and exercises are in German; exams test German terminology.

**Recommendations:**
- Add German glossary with key terms:
  - Mittelwert = Mean, Standardabweichung = Standard Deviation
  - Konfidenzintervall = Confidence Interval, Hypothesentest = Hypothesis Test
- Include German mathematical notation where appropriate
- Add sidebar with German equivalents for key concepts

### 🚨 Limited Exam Preparation Focus
**Current Issue:** Good content but not exam-optimized.

**Specific Problems:**
- Missing time management tips for calculations
- No "Altklausuren" (past exam) style questions
- Limited emphasis on common HSG trick questions

**HSG Context:** Exams are time-pressured; need to recognize patterns from past exams.

**Recommendations:**
- Add "Exam Strategy" sections
- Include past exam-style questions
- Add timing guidelines: "Spend no more than 5 minutes on Aufgabe 1a"

## 4. Priority Recommendations for Maximum Grade Impact

### Immediate (High Impact, Low Effort)
1. **Add Business Context Headers**
   ```
   Business Context: A consulting firm needs to determine if a new training program improves employee productivity by more than 5%.
   Statistical Question: Is μ > 5%?
   ```

2. **Include German Terminology**
   Add sidebars: "German: Mittelwert (Mean), Varianz (Variance)"

3. **Add Decision-Making Framework**
   After each test: "Business Decision: [Accept/Reject] the program"

### Medium-term (High Impact, Medium Effort)
1. **Restructure Exercises to HSG Format**
   - Use "Aufgabe 1a), 1b), 1c)" structure
   - Include exact calculation table formats
   - Add German column headers

2. **Add Business Case Studies**
   - Replace generic examples with Swiss company scenarios
   - Include consulting-style interpretations

3. **Include Past Exam Patterns**
   - Add "Common Exam Questions" sections
   - Include trick questions HSG professors use

### Long-term (High Impact, High Effort)
1. **Create Business Decision Trees**
   - Flowcharts for choosing statistical methods
   - Business context for method selection

2. **Add Video/Interactive Elements**
   - Business case walkthroughs
   - Interactive calculation builders

3. **Integrate with Excel/Google Sheets**
   - Practical tools we actually use in business

---

## 5. Expected Grade Impact

**Current Bootcamp:** Supports 4.0-4.5 grade
- Good for basic understanding
- Missing business context and exam precision

**With Recommended Improvements:** Could support 5.5-6.0 grade
- Business-relevant examples improve application questions
- HSG-aligned format improves calculation accuracy
- Decision-making framework improves interpretation questions

**Key Insight:** HSG exams test both technical calculation skills AND business judgment. The bootcamp currently excels at the former but neglects the latter.

---

## 6. Final Recommendations

**For Bootcamp Creators:**
1. Partner with HSG alumni for business examples
2. Analyze actual Übungsblätter more deeply
3. Include German instructors for terminology
4. Focus on business decision-making applications

**For Fellow Students:**
- Use this bootcamp for technical practice
- Supplement with business case studies
- Practice with official Übungsblätter
- Focus on interpretation, not just calculations

**Overall Assessment:** With the recommended improvements, this could become the definitive HSG statistics preparation resource. Currently it's a good technical supplement but needs significant business context enhancement to maximize learning success and exam performance.

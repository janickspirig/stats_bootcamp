## 🔑 Key Formulas

| Concept | Formula |
|---------|---------|
| Complement | P(A') = 1 - P(A) |
| Addition Rule | P(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A ∩ B) |
| Multiplication Rule | P(A ∩ B) = P(A\|B) × P(B) |
| Conditional Probability | P(A\|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B) |
| Bayes' Theorem | P(A\|B) = [P(B\|A) × P(A)] / P(B) |

See [Formula Glossary](../reference/formula_glossary.md) for complete formulas.

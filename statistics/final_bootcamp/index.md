## About This Bootcamp

- **Purpose:** Complementary exam preparation for HSG Statistics course
- **Format:** Self-paced, topic-based learning
- **Total Time:** ~16-20 hours
- **Content:** Theory, worked examples, practice problems

---

## Exam relevance & typical tasks (what you must do by hand)

You should be able to do these quickly and cleanly (formula → substitution → answer → interpretation):

- Build calculation tables (means, deviations, squares, frequency tables)
- Standardize with z-scores and read the z-table (including symmetry/complement)
- Pick the right distribution (Binomial vs Poisson vs Hypergeometric; Normal/Exponential)
- Construct confidence intervals for mean and proportion
- Execute hypothesis tests using the **same 5-step template** every time
- Interpret outputs in one business sentence (what decision does this support?)

## Revision sprint (10 minutes)

If you’re short on time, do this:

1. **2 minutes:** Skim the [Formula Glossary](reference/formula_glossary.md) (Ctrl/Cmd+F for what you need)
2. **5 minutes:** Do 3 fast drills:
   - Drill A (descriptive stats): [Exercise 1](exercises/exercise_1.md)
   - Drill B (probability): [Exercise 2](exercises/exercise_2.md)
   - Drill C (hypothesis testing): [Exercise 5](exercises/exercise_5.md)
3. **3 minutes:** Review common traps: [Common Mistakes](reference/common_mistakes.md)

## If you get stuck… (remediation map)

- **SD vs SE vs σ/√n confusion** → `07_sampling_distributions/standard_error.md`
- **Which distribution to use** → `05_discrete_distributions/choosing_distribution.md` and `exercises/exercise_3a.md`
- **Z-table / Normal probabilities** → `06_continuous_distributions/normal_probabilities.md` and `exercises/exercise_3b.md`
- **Which statistical test to use** → `reference/which_test.md`
- **Hypothesis test mechanics (α vs α/2, df, decision wording)** → `09_hypothesis_testing_basics/testing_framework.md`
- **Regression table / slope calculation** → `12_regression_analysis/fitting_regression.md` and `exercises/exercise_6.md`

## Getting Started

1. Check the [Prerequisites](00_start_here/prerequisites.md)
2. Review the [Study Path](00_start_here/study_path.md)
3. Start with [Module 01](01_foundations/index.md)

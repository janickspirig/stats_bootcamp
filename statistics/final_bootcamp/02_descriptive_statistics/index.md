## 🎯 Learning Objectives

After completing this module, you will be able to:
- Calculate and interpret measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode)
- Calculate and interpret measures of dispersion (variance, standard deviation, MAD, IQR)
- Understand and interpret quartiles and box plots
- Identify and describe the shape of distributions (skewness, kurtosis)
- Build and interpret basic frequency tables (relative and cumulative) for grouped data (exam-style)

## Topics in This Module

📄 **[I can calculate and interpret the mean, median, and mode](mean_median_mode.md)**
The three primary measures of central tendency and when to use each.

📄 **[I can calculate variance and standard deviation](variance_stddev.md)**
Measuring the spread of data around the mean (including MAD and CV).

📄 **[I can build frequency tables (f and F)](frequency_tables.md)**
Relative and cumulative frequency tables (exam-style).

📄 **[I can interpret quartiles and box plots](quartiles_boxplots.md)**
Dividing data into quarters and visualizing distributions.

📄 **[I can identify skewness and kurtosis](skewness_kurtosis.md)**
Describing the shape of distributions beyond center and spread.

## 🔑 Key Formulas

> 🔑 **Core Formulas for this module:**

| Measure | Formula |
|---------|---------|
| Mean (sample) | x̄ = (Σxᵢ) / n |
| Weighted mean | x̄w = (Σwᵢxᵢ) / (Σwᵢ) |
| Variance (sample) | s² = Σ(xᵢ - x̄)² / (n-1) |
| Standard Deviation | s = √s² |
| Coefficient of Variation | CV = (s / x̄) × 100% |
| Mean Absolute Deviation | MAD = (1/n) Σ|xᵢ - x̄| |

See [Formula Glossary](../reference/formula_glossary.md) for complete formulas with LaTeX notation.

## Topic Priority by Exam Weight

> 💡 **Tip:** Focus your time on high-priority topics first—they make up the majority of exam questions!

Based on typical statistics exams:

### High Priority (Practice These Most)
| Topic | Modules | Why Important |
|-------|---------|---------------|
| Hypothesis Testing | 09, 10, 11 | ~30-40% of exam |
| Confidence Intervals | 08 | ~15-20% of exam |
| Distributions | 05, 06 | Foundation for inference |
| Regression | 12 | ~15-20% of exam |

### Medium Priority
| Topic | Modules | Why Important |
|-------|---------|---------------|
| Probability | 04 | Foundation concepts |
| Descriptive Statistics | 02 | Quick calculation questions |
| Correlation | 03 | Often combined with regression |

### Lower Priority (Review if Time Allows)
| Topic | Modules | Why Important |
|-------|---------|---------------|
| Data Types | 01 | Usually just definitions |
| ANOVA/Chi-square | 13 | Advanced topics, less frequent |
| Sampling Theory | 07 | Conceptual, less calculation |

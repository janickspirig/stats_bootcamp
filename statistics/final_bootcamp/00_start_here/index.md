## Exam-Day Checklist

### 15 minutes before the exam

- **Materials**: calculator, pens, ruler (if used), allowed formula sheet/tables (if permitted).
- **Warm-up (fast)**:
  - Skim the [Common Mistakes](../reference/common_mistakes.md) checklist.
  - Open the [Formula Glossary](../reference/formula_glossary.md) and locate: SD vs SE, CI formulas, z/t test statistics, regression slope.

### During the exam (point-saving habits)

- **Always write the template** (especially for tests):
  - \(H_0\\), \(H_1\\) → α + tail → statistic (formula + substitution) → critical value/p-value → decision → conclusion in context.
- **Two-tailed trap**: use **α/2** for critical values.
- **SD vs SE trap**: means/tests use \(\\sigma/\\sqrt{n}\\) or \(s/\\sqrt{n}\\), not σ or s.
- **Variance trap**: sample variance uses \(n-1\\).
- **Complement trick**: “at least one” → \(1-P(X=0)\\).
- **Final line**: add one business interpretation sentence (what decision does this support?).

### Final 2-minute check per task

- Did you pick the right distribution/test?
- Did you use the right tail (and α/2 if two-tailed)?
- Did you show substitution steps (numbers in the formula)?
- Does the conclusion match the question wording?

## Math Prerequisites

This bootcamp assumes you have the following mathematical foundation:

### Essential Skills (Must Have)

| Skill | Example | You Should Be Able To... |
|-------|---------|--------------------------|
| Basic algebra | Solve 2x + 5 = 15 | Solve for unknown variables |
| Fractions | 3/4 + 1/2 = ? | Add, subtract, multiply, divide fractions |
| Exponents | 2³ = ?, √16 = ? | Work with powers and roots |
| Summation notation | Σᵢ₌₁ⁿ xᵢ | Understand and calculate sums |
| Order of operations | 3 + 4 × 2 = ? | Apply PEMDAS correctly |
| Scientific notation | 1.5 × 10⁻³ | Work with very large/small numbers |

### Helpful (Nice to Have)

- Basic calculus concepts (for understanding continuous distributions)
- Familiarity with spreadsheets (for calculation practice)
- Comfort with Greek letters (α, β, μ, σ, etc.)

## Self-Assessment Quiz

Try these problems to check your readiness. Solutions are hidden below.

### Problem 1: Algebra

Solve for x:

$$
\frac{x - 10}{2.5} = 1.96
$$

<details>
<summary>💡 Show Solution</summary>

**Solution:**

1. Multiply both sides by 2.5:

$$
x - 10 = 1.96 \times 2.5 = 4.9
$$

2. Add 10 to both sides:

$$
x = 4.9 + 10 = 14.9
$$

**Answer:** x = 14.9

</details>

### Problem 2: Summation

Given the values: 4, 7, 9, 12, 8

Calculate the sum and the mean:

$$
\sum_{i=1}^{5} x_i = ? \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i = ?
$$

<details>
<summary>💡 Show Solution</summary>

**Solution:**

1. Sum: 4 + 7 + 9 + 12 + 8 = 40
2. Mean: 40 / 5 = 8

**Answer:** Sum = 40, Mean = 8

</details>

---

### Problem 3: Squared Differences

Given the values: 4, 7, 9, 12, 8 (and mean = 8 from above)

Calculate:

$$
\sum_{i=1}^{5} (x_i - \bar{x})^2
$$

<details>
<summary>💡 Show Solution</summary>

**Solution:**

| xᵢ | xᵢ - x̄ | (xᵢ - x̄)² |
|-----|---------|-----------|
| 4 | 4 - 8 = -4 | 16 |
| 7 | 7 - 8 = -1 | 1 |
| 9 | 9 - 8 = 1 | 1 |
| 12 | 12 - 8 = 4 | 16 |
| 8 | 8 - 8 = 0 | 0 |
| **Σ** | 0 | **34** |

**Answer:** 34

</details>

---

### Problem 4: Square Roots and Division

Calculate:

$$
\sqrt{\frac{34}{4}}
$$

<details>
<summary>💡 Show Solution</summary>

**Solution:**

1. Divide: 34 / 4 = 8.5
2. Square root: √8.5 ≈ 2.92

**Answer:** ≈ 2.92

</details>

---

### Problem 5: Factorials and Combinations

Calculate:

$$
\binom{5}{2} = \frac{5!}{2!(5-2)!}
$$

<details>
<summary>💡 Show Solution</summary>

**Solution:**

1. Calculate factorials: 5! = 120, 2! = 2, 3! = 6
2. Substitute: 120 / (2 × 6) = 120 / 12 = 10

**Answer:** 10

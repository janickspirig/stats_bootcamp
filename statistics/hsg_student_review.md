# HSG BBA Student Opinion on the Statistics Bootcamp

*Written from the perspective of the typical HSG BBA student (see `HSG_BBA_Student_Profile.txt`): ambitious, business-driven, minimal statistics experience, high expectation for structured, practice-heavy materials.*

## First Impressions

This bootcamp respects the HSG learning style: it opens with clearly stated **"I know / I can"** goals, uses business scenarios instead of abstract theory, and keeps the tone professional. That mirrors the CS Bootcamp advice in `statistics/CS_BOOTCAMP_BEST_PRACTICES.md` and makes the content feel relevant from the first page.

## What Works for Me

- **Structured Hierarchy + Learning Goals** – Modules are grouped under meaningful headers with subpages that dive into single skills. The learning goal checklist functions like the master page the CS Bootcamp recommends, so I know exactly what I can do after each section.
- **Practice-Heavy, Übungsblatt-Style Exercises** – The calculation tables, substitution steps, and multi-part problems remind me of the HSG exercise sheets. Showing formulas symbolically, then plugging in values, then writing final answers keeps me calm during exams.
- **Visual and Self-Service Support** – Diagrams for test selection, the FAQ in expandable `<details>` blocks, and a formula glossary are exactly the sorts of aids I need when I study between lectures.
- **Business Context & Interpretation Focus** – Every worked example ends with a decision-making summary (“what would this change for marketing/finance?”), which aligns with my consulting/finance aspirations and keeps me engaged.

## Where I Still Need Help

1. **Semester Quiz Collections** – I rely on past exams (`Altklausuren`) to calibrate timing. The CS Bootcamp’s semester-based quiz folders are a blueprint; replicating them (e.g., `quizzes/HS_24/`, `quizzes/FS_25/`) would make this bootcamp exam-proof.
2. **Deeper Python Bridges** – Excel is comfortable, Python feels optional. Adding optional snippets (for example, linking the manual t-test with `scipy.stats.ttest_ind`) would let motivated students transition toward code without losing the pure calculation practice that HSG expects.
3. **Short Video Explainers for Hard Topics** – Complex ideas like the Central Limit Theorem still feel abstract. A 3–5 minute video that narrates the CLT or hypothesis testing steps would capture my attention more than another paragraph of text.
4. **FAQ / Checklist Expansion** – The existing FAQ is helpful, but adding questions about power analysis, effect size interpretation, and decision criteria for one-tailed vs. two-tailed tests would match the “self-service” philosophy the CS Bootcamp champions.

## Conclusion & Next Steps

This bootcamp already mirrors the CS Bootcamp’s best practices in structure, visuals, and practice. From the HSG BBA standpoint, the missing quiz collections and optional Python connections are the only things keeping it from being exam-perfect. I would keep using it for finals if those gaps are addressed. Until then, I pair it with actual HS/FS Übungsblätter, but I am confident the creators are on the same page as HSG students and just need to top off the toolkit with the final pieces mentioned above.

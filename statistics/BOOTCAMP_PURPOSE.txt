STATISTICS BOOTCAMP - PURPOSE & GUIDING PRINCIPLES
For AI Agent: Bootcamp Structure Definition
================================================================================

Document Purpose: This file provides high-level guidance for an AI agent 
tasked with creating the concrete bootcamp structure in Notion. It synthesizes
the student profile, available lecture/exercise content, and pedagogical 
requirements.

================================================================================
1. MISSION STATEMENT
================================================================================

The Statistics Bootcamp is a complementary learning resource designed to 
accelerate HSG Bachelor in Business Administration students' exam preparation 
for the course "3,120 Methoden: Statistik". It does NOT replace lectures or 
exercises but provides structured review, practice, and self-assessment to 
help students efficiently consolidate their understanding and build confidence 
before the exam.

================================================================================
2. TARGET AUDIENCE
================================================================================

WHO: HSG BBA Students (University of St. Gallen, Switzerland)
- Age: 18-22 years
- Background: High school graduates (Swiss Matura, German Abitur, IB)
- Statistics level at entry: BEGINNER TO NONE
- Math level: Intermediate (high school completion)
- Programming: Minimal (not required for this bootcamp)

KEY CHARACTERISTICS:
- Highly ambitious, career-focused (consulting, finance, management)
- Expect practical, applicable knowledge with clear ROI on time
- Prefer practice-oriented learning over pure theory
- Accustomed to rigorous, structured academic programs
- Strong English proficiency (program requirement)

WHAT THEY NEED FROM THIS BOOTCAMP:
- Rapid review of core concepts before exam
- Extensive practice with step-by-step calculations
- Clear formula references and application patterns
- Self-assessment to identify weak areas
- Business-contextualized examples that resonate

================================================================================
3. COURSE COVERAGE (Source Material Available)
================================================================================

The bootcamp is based on the HSG course "3,120 Methoden: Statistik" taught by
Prof. Dr. Roland Füss. All lecture and exercise content has been extracted.

3. Probability Theory
4. Random Variables and Discrete Distributions
5. Continuous, Normal and Exponential Distributions
6. Multi-Dimensional Random Variables
7. Sampling Distributions
8. Estimation Theory
9. Test Theory and One-Sample Procedures
10. Two-Sample Procedures
11. Linear Regression
12. Multiple Regression and Chi-Square/ANOVA

EXERCISES (7 exercise sheets, 335 pages):
- Exercise 1: Location and Dispersion Parameters (47 pages)
- Exercise 2: Introduction to Probability (75 pages)
- Exercise 3A/3B: Probability Distributions (81 pages)

================================================================================
4. BOOTCAMP GOALS
================================================================================

PRIMARY GOAL: Exam Readiness Acceleration
- Students should complete the bootcamp feeling confident and prepared
- Focus on high-yield topics most likely to appear on exams
- Provide enough practice to achieve fluency in standard problem types

SECONDARY GOALS:
a) Concept Consolidation
   - Review key formulas and when to apply them
   - Clarify common points of confusion
   - Connect related concepts across topics

b) Calculation Fluency
   - Practice step-by-step problem solving
   - Build speed and accuracy with standard procedures
   - Develop table-based calculation habits (HSG exam format)

c) Self-Assessment
   - Help students identify their weak areas
   - Provide targeted practice for struggling topics
   - Build confidence through progressive mastery

WHAT THIS BOOTCAMP IS NOT:
- Not a replacement for attending lectures
- Not a comprehensive textbook
- Not an introduction for complete beginners (assumes lecture attendance)
- Not focused on programming/R (pure statistics focus)

================================================================================
5. PEDAGOGICAL PRINCIPLES
================================================================================

Based on HSG student profile and actual exercise format:

PRINCIPLE 1: Formula → Substitution → Answer
- Always show the formula symbolically first
- Then show values substituted into the formula
- Then show the computed result
- This matches HSG exam answer format expectations

PRINCIPLE 2: Calculation Tables Are Essential
- HSG exercises heavily use tabular calculation layouts
- Build tables with intermediate columns (xi, xi-x̄, (xi-x̄)², etc.)
- Show running sums (Σ) at the bottom
- Students must practice building these tables themselves

PRINCIPLE 3: Business Context Matters
- Use examples from finance, marketing, operations
- Frame statistics as a decision-making tool
- Include Swiss/European company examples where natural
- Avoid overly abstract mathematical examples

PRINCIPLE 4: Progressive Difficulty
- Start each topic with direct formula application
- Build to multi-step problems
- End with integration exercises combining concepts
- Match the Aufgabe 1-2 → Aufgabe 3-4 → Aufgabe 5-6 progression

PRINCIPLE 5: Efficient Learning
- These students value time efficiency
- Be concise - no unnecessary elaboration
- Focus on what will be tested
- Provide clear "need to know" vs. "nice to know" signals

================================================================================
6. BOOTCAMP STRUCTURE GUIDANCE
================================================================================

RECOMMENDED MODULE ORGANIZATION (13 topic modules):
1. Introduction to Data & Statistics

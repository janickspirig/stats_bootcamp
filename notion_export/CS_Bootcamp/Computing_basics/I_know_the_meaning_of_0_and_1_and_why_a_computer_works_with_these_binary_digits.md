# I know the meaning of 0 and 1 and why a computer works with these binary digits

# Introduction
Binary system is a number system of base 2 and it gets its name from the two digits it uses - 0 and 1. Due to the simplicity, the binary numerical system is optimum for use in computers.
---
# Binary and Computers
Computers use binary because they have circuits that are either on or off, which gives these circuits two possible states. The binary number system integrates perfectly with this on-off setup. The '1' reflects the 'on' state, while the '0' reflects the 'off' state.

## Inside the Computer
- **Logic Gates**: These are the fundamental building blocks of digital circuitry and work with binary inputs. Logic Gates transform the initial binary inputs into output using boolean functions.
Example: the AND gate produces an output of '1' only when both its inputs are '1'.
```plain text
    Input A  Input B  Output
         0        0       0
         0        1       0
         1        0       0
         1        1       1
```
- **Transistors**: Transistors are electronic devices that function like switches, turning current on or off. They represent the '1' and '0' states of binary in computer hardware.

# Binary Number System
A binary number is expressed in the base-2 numeral system, which uses only two symbols: 0 and 1.
- **Counting in Binary**: Each digit is referred to as a bit. Unlike the decimal system where the place value increases by a power of 10, in binary it increases by a power of 2.
---
# Why Binary?
Binary is primarily used because of its simplicity and efficacy in terms of data representation and operations. Storing data in binary format makes processing and data manipulation swift and logical.
---
# How is Binary Used in Computers?
- **Data Representation**: Each bit or combination of bits represents different forms of data such as text, numbers, graphics, and audio.
Example: ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) represents each character as a unique 7-bit binary code. For instance, 'A' is 65 in decimal or 1000001 in binary.
- **Performing Operations**: Operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division using binary numbers are straightforward and easy to implement with digital circuitry.

# I know the difference between the Internet and the World Wide Web (WWW)

---
### Overview
**The Internet** and **The World Wide Web (WWW)**  are two concepts commonly used interchangeably, but they present different facets of network-based communication systems.
### Internet
The Internet is a massive network of networks, a networking infrastructure. It connects millions of computers together globally, forming a network in which any computer can communicate with any other computer as long as both are connected to the Internet.
- **Example:** Email services, such as Gmail, Exchange, etc., operate over the Internet but are not part of the World Wide Web.
### World Wide Web
The World Wide Web, or simply Web, is a way of accessing information over the medium of the Internet. It utilizes the HTTP protocol and is an information-sharing model that is built on top of the Internet.
- **Example:** When you type a URL into your web browser (like [www.google.com](http://www.google.com/)), this is part of the World Wide Web, it's not the Internet itself.

### Understanding the Difference: Internet vs. WWW
The Internet can be compared to a highway system, with the World Wide Web being a specific vehicle you use to navigate that system. The Internet is the physical infrastructure, while the WWW is a service that operates over this infrastructure.
### Key Differences:
1. **Accessibility:** The Internet can be accessed without a browser through services like email, FTP (File Transfer Protocol), and SSH (Secure Shell). The WWW is accessed via a web browser.
1. **Founders:** Internet was a result of research commissioned by the United States government in the 1960s to build robust, fault-tolerant communication. The WWW was invented by Tim Berners-Lee in 1989.
1. **Protocols Used:** The Internet uses TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) to send and receive data. The WWW uses HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) or HTTPS (secure) to transmit data.
1. **Usage:** The Internet is used for a variety of communication services such as email, instant messaging, file transfer, and the interlinked web pages and other documents of the World Wide Web. The World Wide Web is one of the services communicated via the Internet. It is a collection of interconnected documents (web pages) and other web resources, linked by hyperlinks and URIs.

### Summing Up
While the Internet and the World Wide Web remain intertwined, they each serve their specific functionalities in the sphere of global communication. Recognizing their differences will help understand and appreciate the complexity and intricacy of modern communication systems.

---------------------------------------------------------
"Given the following data points: 17, 18, 19, 19, 21, 22, 25

a) Calculate the Range (Spannweite):
   Range = x_max - x_min = 25 - 17 = 8

b) Calculate the Mean (Mittelwert):
   x̄ = (17+18+19+19+21+22+25)/7 = 141/7 = 20.14

c) Calculate the Mean Absolute Deviation (Mittlere Absolute Abweichung):
   Build the following table:

   | xi  | xi - x̄  | |xi - x̄| |
   |-----|---------|----------|
   | 17  | -3.14   | 3.14     |
   | 18  | -2.14   | 2.14     |
   | 19  | -1.14   | 1.14     |
   | 19  | -1.14   | 1.14     |
   | 21  |  0.86   | 0.86     |
   | 22  |  1.86   | 1.86     |
   | 25  |  4.86   | 4.86     |
   | Σ   |         | 15.14    |

   MAD = (1/n) × Σ|xi - x̄| = (1/7) × 15.14 = 2.16"

AUFGABE 2 - FREQUENCY DISTRIBUTION (Übungsblatt 1 Style):
---------------------------------------------------------
"A survey of 2567 households recorded the number of persons per household:

| Persons (xi) | Count (ni) |
|--------------|------------|
| 1            | 457        |
| 2            | 628        |
| 3            | 612        |
| 4            | 526        |
| ≥5           | 344        |
| Σ            | 2567       |

a) Calculate the relative frequency f(xi) = ni/n for each category
b) Calculate the cumulative distribution F(xi) = Σf(xi)
c) In how many households are there 3 or fewer persons?
   F(xi = 3) = 66.1% → 2567 × 0.661 = 1697 households"

AUFGABE 3 - PROBABILITY (Übungsblatt 2 Style):
----------------------------------------------
"A manufacturer produces solar cells. Let A = {cell is defective} and 
B = {cell has cosmetic damage}. Given:
   P(A) = P({0,1}) = 0.9
   P(B) = P({1,2,3}) = 0.3
   P(B̄) = P({0}) = 0.7

Calculate P(A ∩ B) - the probability that exactly one cell is defective.

Solution using: P(A ∩ B) = P(A) - P(A\B)
   P(A ∩ B) = 0.9 - 0.7 = 0.2
   or: P({0,1}) - P({0}) = P({1}) = 0.2"

AUFGABE 4 - CONFIDENCE INTERVAL (Übungsblatt 4 Style):
------------------------------------------------------
"A bottling company fills bottles with a mean μ = 62 hours of overtime per 
month, with standard deviation σ = 15 hours. A sample of n = 36 employees 
is taken.

a) What is the probability that the sample mean falls between 55 and 65?

   P(55 < X̄ < 65) = P((55-62)/2.5 < Z < (65-62)/2.5)
                   = P(-2.80 < Z < 1.20)
   
   From table: z = 2.80 → 0.9974
               z = 1.20 → 0.8849
   
   P(-2.80 < Z < 1.20) = 0.8849 - (1 - 0.9974) = 0.8823

b) Construct a 95% confidence interval for the mean:
   [X̄ - z₀.₀₂₅ × σ/√n ; X̄ + z₀.₀₂₅ × σ/√n]
   [x̄ - 1.96 × 2.5 ; x̄ + 1.96 × 2.5] = [x̄ - 4.9 ; x̄ + 4.9]"

AUFGABE 5 - HYPOTHESIS TESTING (Übungsblatt 5 Style):
-----------------------------------------------------
"A company claims average delivery time is μ₀ = 2100 minutes. A sample 
shows x̄ = 2150 with σ = 125 and n = 25. Test at α = 0.025.

1. Hypotheses:
   H₀: μ = 2100 (delivery time is as claimed)
   H₁: μ > 2100 (one-tailed, testing if longer)

2. Test statistic:
   z = (x̄ - μ₀)/(σ/√n) = (2150 - 2100)/(125/5) = 50/25 = 2.0

3. Critical value:
   z₀.₀₂₅ = 1.96

4. Decision:
   z = 2.0 > 1.96 → Reject H₀
   
5. Type II Error (β) for μ₁ = 2150:
   β(μ₁ = 2150) = P(X̄ < 2100 | μ = 2150)
                = P(Z < (2100-2150)/25) = P(Z < -2) = 0.0228"

AUFGABE 6 - REGRESSION (Übungsblatt 6 Style):
---------------------------------------------
"Sales representatives' data:

| Rep | xi (visits) | yi (sales) | xiyi  | xi²  | xi-x̄ | (xi-x̄)² | yi-ȳ | (yi-ȳ)² |
|-----|-------------|------------|-------|------|-------|---------|------|---------|
| 1   | 14          | 10         | 140   | 196  | -2    | 4       |-2.4  | 5.76    |
| 2   | 17          | 9          | 153   | 289  | 1     | 1       |-3.4  | 11.56   |
| 3   | 9           | 8          | 72    | 81   | -7    | 49      |-4.4  | 19.36   |
| 4   | 21          | 19         | 399   | 441  | 5     | 25      | 6.6  | 43.56   |
| 5   | 19          | 16         | 304   | 361  | 3     | 9       | 3.6  | 12.96   |
| Σ   | 80          | 62         | 1068  | 1368 |       | 88      |      | 93.2    |

Calculate the regression coefficients:

β̂ = Cov(X,Y)/Var(X) = [(1/n-1)(Σxiyi - nx̄ȳ)] / [(1/n-1)(Σxi² - nx̄²)]
  = (1/4 × 1068 - 5×16×12.4) / (1/4 × (1368 - 80²/5))
  = (1/4 × (1068 - 992)) / (1/4 × 88)
  = 19/22 = 0.8636

α̂ = ȳ - β̂x̄ = 12.4 - 0.8636 × 16 = -1.4182

Regression equation: ŷi = -1.4182 + 0.8636xi + εi"
